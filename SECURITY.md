# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the TabMail Thunderbird add-on,
please report it privately. **Do not open a public issue.**

Email **security@tabmail.ai** with:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- The affected add-on version (see `manifest.json` → `version`)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and to provide a remediation
timeline after triage.

## Scope

This repository covers the Thunderbird add-on only. The native full-text-search
host, the iOS client, and the backend service have their own repositories /
contact points; vulnerabilities in those should be reported to the same address
with the affected component named.

Note that the add-on authenticates to and exchanges data with the TabMail
backend over HTTPS. Issues in the hosted backend service should also be reported
to **security@tabmail.ai**.

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. Please give us a reasonable window to ship a
fix before any public disclosure. There is no paid bug-bounty program at this
time; we are grateful for responsible reports and will credit reporters who wish
to be acknowledged.
