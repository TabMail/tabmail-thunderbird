## Not allowed without written permission

- Using the TabMail Name (or any TabMail branding) in a way that **suggests endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation** by Lisem AI Ltd when none exists.

- Using “TabMail” or TabMail branding in extension listings, marketing materials, domains, social accounts, or screenshots in a way that is likely to cause **confusion** about whether the build is official.
- Registering or using confusingly similar names or branding intended to trade on TabMail’s goodwill.
